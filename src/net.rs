//! HERE BE DRAGONS, IF YOU TOUCH THIS CODE YOU WILL BE CURSED
//!
//! This module provides utilities for working with TCP sockets in an asynchronous context using Tokio.
//! It handles sending and receiving size-prefixed messages and packets with client IDs. The module
//! ensures cancellation safety where applicable, allowing for robust handling of asynchronous operations.
//!
//! If you call ANYTHING from this module, make SURE to read the notes about cancellation safety in each
//! doc comment. If you don't, you will be cursed and your code will be haunted by the ghosts of the braincells
//! who had to die in the tens of hours of work debugging and testing this code to make sure it's cancellation safe
//! where needed.
//!
//! If you want to touch this, read up on cancellation safety in Rust and the Tokio documentation, first.
//! Then, grab a {drink_of_choice}, block a time slot of a few hours, and enjoy yourself.
//! Finally, make sure you can explain why the code is the way it is before you change it. And please, don't
//! assume that it was ever correct; so if you find a bug, it's probably real.
//!
